//-> The problem seems to be tricky at first that how will i first sum and then subtract 
//-> You may have a different way to solve this question and yes you can solve this in many way but this is the most easy and best way that you should must learn 
//-> For solving this question we are going to use the concept of the odd and the even term if the element is at odd postion then wer are going to subtract it
//-> If the element is at the the even position then we are going to add it to the sum and return the sum as the answer.
