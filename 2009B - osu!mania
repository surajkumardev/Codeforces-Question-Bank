-> How to approach the question <-
//1-> As you can see that there are n rows and 4 columns 
//So we are going to use the 2D array which is used to create a matrix like structure
//We will take the input using the first loop
//Then in the second loop we are going to iterate from the last row as given in the question 
//i-> n-1 -> denoting the last element from the array till the i>=0
//j=0 to j<4 denoting the column in the matrix that we have created 
// Then we are going to check the value is equal to # or not if yes
//We will print the Column as (j+1) as we have started from the 0th index only. 
//Submit
