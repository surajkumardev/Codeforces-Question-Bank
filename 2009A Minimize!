->This is the easiest question that you will find on the Codeforce 
-> You may want to use loop iterate the value of c and many more concept 
-> But this can be solved by using the concept of just adding the value which will result you the answer 
-> Like-> (c-a)+(b-c)= B-A only which is your required answer
-> Code Start From here
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  

int main() {  
    int t;  
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {  
        int a, b;  
        cin >> a >> b; // Read the values of a and b  
        // The minimum value of (c - a) + (b - c) is simply b - a  
        cout << (b - a) << endl;
    }  
    return 0;  
}
